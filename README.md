# Portal Box
## About
The PortalBox project is the work of a number of students, student teams, and staff members at Bucknell University to create a low cost solution for controlling access to and tracking usage of equipment in the MakerSpaces on campus. The resultant work is an IoT appliance build around a Raspberry Pi 0 W which communicates with a MySQL Database and a Web Interface for controlling the system.

The various software projects are shared in their own repositoryies so they can be individually cloned where appropriate.
